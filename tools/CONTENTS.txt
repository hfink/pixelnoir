This folder contains python scripts that are either used by the SCons build
process directly, or can be used separately for other tasks. 

Here is a description of the folder contents: 

    ./pltreegen
        Contains scripts that generate trees based on a parametric L-system.
        There is a separate README in its folder.

    ./config_header_template.hh
    ./config_source_template.cc
        Templates which are used for the config loader source generation
 
    ./extGL_header_template.hh
    ./extGL_source_template.cc
        Templates which are used for the OpenGL extension load source 
        generation.

    ./configGen.py
        Script for code generation of config loaders.

    ./extensionGen.py
        Script for code generation of an OpenGL extension loader.

    ./formatMapGen.py
        Script for OpenGL format descriptions.

    ./make_dist.py
        A script that is used to create a 'dist' folder of the project, i.e.
        it takes care of copying files into one place which can be used
        to distribute an executable version of a project (requires that
        a release version of the player and the bakery has been built before.)

    ./material_bakery.py
        Reads ../player/materials/material.xml and patches a specific *.rtr
        file to contain the manually specified material parameters.

    ./rebake_all.py
        A handy script which automatically rebakes ALL files under
        ../collada_bakery/assets_collada. All outputs will be placed
        in ../player/asset. Attention: this overwrites all existing *.rtr
        without further notice.
