The currently shipped OpenCollada is built from a patched version available
at ssh://hfink.eu/home/rtr/OpenCollada.

=== Windows ===

VS2010 static libs, DLL runtime, in debug and release are included.

=== Linux Build Instructions ===

The static libs shipped with out source tree are built on Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick
using GCC 4.4.5.

To build it by yourself, 
 
get a custom patched OpenCollada source tree from the GIT repo at 

ssh://hfink.eu/home/rtr/OpenCollada 

You will need to checkout the sid_patch remote branch and build the sources 
contained in this branch.

I recommend building the lib with the following parameters: 

scons RELEASE=1 LIBDIRNAME=lib/ PCRENATIVE=1 XMLPARSER=libxmlNative

You will also have to install

libpcre3-dev
libxml2-dev

Note that there are shipped sources of these libraries as well that come with
the OpenCollada source tree, just in case you have a hard time installing
the native libs on your system, although using native libs is of course the
preferred way.

After building you will have to copy these static libs into 

./ColladaBakery/external/OpenCollada/lib/linux : 

libGeneratedSaxParser.a
libMathMLSolver.a
libUTF.a
libOpenCOLLADABaseUtils.a
libOpenCOLLADAFramework.a
libOpenCOLLADASaxFrameworkLoader.a
libOpenCOLLADAStreamWriter.a
